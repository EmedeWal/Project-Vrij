    dialogueText: Not much has been going my way lately. I feel a little overwhelmed.
      How would you deal with that feeling?
    responses:
    - responseText: I would keep it together.
      nextNode:
        dialogueText: 'Really? That seems difficult. Is there any particular reason
          for the way you deal with misfortune? '
        responses:
        - responseText: "I don\u2019t want to be a burden."
          nextNode:
            dialogueText: I recognize that feeling, but it is important to remember
              that if we are a burden to our friends when we need them, they might
              not be the best of friends.

                dialogueText: "That\u2019s okay. Sometimes you just need some time
                  to figure everything out. Could you take me back to mother? I miss
                  her."
                responses:
                - responseText: Of course.

            dialogueText: "I simply don\u2019t believe that. All of us can cry. Sadness
              is an emotion like any other. By blocking it out, you could block out
              Joy and Love, too."

          You can\u2019t heal by ignoring and you can\u2019t be helped by being invisible. "
